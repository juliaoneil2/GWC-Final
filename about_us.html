          <p class='ourinterests' id='interests'>My Interests: I have a wide variety of interests that are all over the place but mostly everything catches my interest because I love learning/exploring new things. Life is too short to be doing nothing. In my free time, I love capturing pictures and videos of moments because of my love for photography as well as videography. In addition, I have such a passion for web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because of the creative aspect of it which allows my inner ideas to come to reality and be free. Furthermore, I love to spread kindness because a simple act of kindness can have the power of just enlightening oneâ€™s day which can forever change their perspective on life and even allow them to return that act of kindness to others.
